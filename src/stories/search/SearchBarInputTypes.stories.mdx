# Search Bar Input Types

The `SearchUI` component accepts a prop called `searchBarAllowedInputTypesMap` to control which kinds of inputs
should be allowed in the search bar and map the different input types to filter fields in the API being queried.
The search bar can handle multiple input types and thus can query different fields depending on the input type
that is detected. This prop determines which API fields to use when a certain input type is detected. Note that
this mapping is 1-to-1, i.e. you can only query one field per input type.

In the object you supply to this prop, the top-level keys are the allowed input types. Those keys should be assigned to objects with
only one property: `field`. The `field` property should be the name of the filter field used in the API.

The possible input types (keys) are:

- formula
- elements
- mpid
- smiles
- text

## Example

```js
{
  formula: {
    field: 'formula'
  },
  elements: {
    field: 'elements'
  },
  mpid: {
    field: 'material_ids'
  }
}
```
